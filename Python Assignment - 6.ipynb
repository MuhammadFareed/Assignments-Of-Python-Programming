    "    Object Oriented Programming Language is a high-level computer programming language that implements objects and \n",
    "their associated procedures within the programming context to create software programs. Object-oriented language uses an\n",
    "object-oriented programming (OOP) technique that binds to related data and functions into an object and encourages reuse\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Modifiability: it is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OOP program. \n",
    "   Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public interface that the external \n",
    "   world has to a class is through the use of methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extensibility: adding new features or responding to changing operating environments can be solved by introducing a few\n",
    "   new objects and modifying some existing ones.\n",

    "5. Maintainability: objects can be maintained separately, making locating and fixing problems easier. \n",

    "    object to invoke or execute one of its methods. From a programming point of view, an object can be a data structure,\n",
